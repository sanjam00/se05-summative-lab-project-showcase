**Shop Page**
render product cards in a more favorable way, i.e, not all in a straight line
change card views, from big to medium to small, based on user preference
add sort functionality, maybe based on caffeinated or not

**Admin Page**
add sort functionality, maybe based on caffeinated or not
add a login functionality, so editing products is restricted
