# Welcome to the SE05 Summative lab Project Showcase!

You are tasked with creating an administrator portal for an e-commerce website which will include.

A landing page describing what the site is about.
A form page that allows for a new product to be added.
A product page that will show the product.
Allow the administrator to change different values of the product such as price.
A search functionality that allows users to dynamically search for a product.
A responsive design that matches the mock-up.

change card views, from big to medium to small, based on user preference
